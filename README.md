## Simpel react setup template
1. clone repository
2. run npm install to get all dependencies
3. start coding

For a easy webpack config I am using Laravel-mix.
Link to **package**: https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix

If you use a different file structure, don't forget to change paths in the 
webpack.mix.js file. 

Use npm run dev  to compile code
Use npm run watch to keep track of file changes
